We recently learned about Docker and used it to package our Java application into a container. This made it really easy to run the app on any machine without needing to manually install Java or worry about different environments. We wrote a simple Dockerfile that uses the OpenJDK 23 image, sets the working directory, copies our Java code into the container, compiles it, and runs the Main.java class. Once we got that working, we connected it with GitHub Actions so that every time we push our code to the main branch, it automatically builds the Docker image and uploads it to DockerHub. This was our first time automating a workflow like this, and it really showed us how tools like Docker and GitHub Actions can make development and deployment faster and more reliable.
